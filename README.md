- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently refining my math and programming skills.
- üå± In the fall of 2022 I focused on learning to code in C, C++, and C#. Then, in Spring of 2023, I focused on learning Python and processing data in Jupyter Notebook. Now, in Fall of 2023, I am focusing on creating full-stack applications, refining my coding skills, and looking for CS experience opportunities. I'm also focusing on gameplay programming as a hobby and potential opportunities in that field.
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on a cybersecurity/cloud project
- ü§î I‚Äôm looking for help with learning cloud services
